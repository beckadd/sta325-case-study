@article{blood-flow,
abstract = {Various previous models used in studying red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis in turbulent shear flows are reviewed from a fluid dynamic point of view. The effect of turbulent shear stress (Reynolds shear stress, $\tau$ R ) on RBC hemolysis is investigated utilizing a submerged axisymmetric jet flow field. A detailed survey of the flow field is made with a laser Doppler anemometer system to obtain contour maps of the mean velocity distributions, relative turbulence intensities, and $\tau$ R distributions in the field prior to conducting the experiment of sampling and analyzing the cells free-hemoglobin in the field. A new two-point sampling technique, developed in this laboratory, allows collections of RBC samples from selected locations in the flow field so that a relationship between the local shear stress level and the cell damage may be established. The threshold level of $\tau$ R responsible for incipient hemolysis is found to be approximately 400 Newtons per square meter (N/m2 ), below which a sublethal region of zero hemolysis is observed.},
